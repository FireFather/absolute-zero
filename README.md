Absolute Zero
=============

Absolute Zero is a bitboard chess engine written in C#. It was developed from scratch to learn about chess programming and game tree searching. By default it runs with its own GUI but it supports the UCI protocol when given the -u command-line parameter. While in UCI/command-line mode it also accepts commands such as perft and divide.
